	- "The two 5-class random forest models individually did much better than the 25-class random forest model; my arousal model had .57 precision and my positivity model had .48 precision. However, the combined result was .35 precision in mood prediction which wasn’t an improvement over the 25-class model."

Filters:
- s['end_time'] ≤ 500 # not too long
- s['end_time'] > 0 # not empty?
- len(s['tempos']) == 1 # no tempo changes
- len(s['time_signature_changes']) == 1 # no time signature changes
- [c.numerator == 4 and c.denominator == 4 for s in statistics for c in s['time_signature_changes']] # only 4/4
- len(s['key_numbers']) == 1 # no key changes
- we have mood for this song (using gracenote api)

Preprocessing:
- remove drums: [i.program for i in pm.instruments if not i.is_drum]
- convert to Cmaj/Amin
